# Occam's Ghost fit
Gaussian mixture fit minimizing the total bit requirement
of the PDF instead of maximizing the likelihood

# gaussian-mixture
Maximum log likelihood fit for Gaussian mixture model in Julia. 
The infinities arising from nearly zero likelihoods are handled 
with an approximation around the largest Gaussian component.
